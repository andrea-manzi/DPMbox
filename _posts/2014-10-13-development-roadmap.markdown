Hello again! I've created a *tentative* development roadmap, you can find it [here]({{site.baseurl}}/roadmap/). As you can see I've set the June 2nd as the project start because that was the date when I get access to the CERN network, anyway at that date and still now the work done is more an approaching work than real development.

I still can't predict which setbacks will slow down the project more (as long as I'm certain that there will be some) but I think it's a realistic overview of what I can expect.
