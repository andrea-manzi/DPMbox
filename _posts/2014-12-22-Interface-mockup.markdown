<!--Hello! Today I want to talk you about a key thing in the development.

While I work on the Using jQuery UI a GUI will be designed and this interface will use the data provided by the WebDAV API previously created. Since we are using jQuery and jQuery UI and these are widely known libraries  the interface could be very customizable and could be easily adapted for other uses or modified for extended support in the future.

UI setbacks.

Deep collections: The directory/collection tree will be loaded with lazy loading and in asynchronous way. Big number of data nodes inside a collection: Use pagination in case of hundreds of files when opening a directory.

Basic demo of the proposed layout built using jQuery UI. It is not yet functional but it can show the actual appearance on a browser. calvellido.es/dpmdemo



The UI development will take advantage of jQuery UI potential. This makes it easy to understand, modify or extend.
Very deep collections could be problematic on loading, so a lazy loading technique will be used, and in asynchronous way. Just not only for loading, also for the user experience this high quantity of nodes could be troublesome, and in this case the pagination could be a solution.

This is the first initial sketch design: you can see the nodes tree, a data section, an information column... (picture)

The translation of the sketch to jQuery UI, still not functional and subject to changes (link).-->
