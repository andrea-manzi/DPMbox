Hi there! My name is Juan Valencia Calvellido and this is the first post of the DPMbox development blog, where I'll try to explain the development of DPMbox, with its ups and downs. I am a Bachelor of Information Technology student at Universidad de CÃ¡diz, you can read more about me in my [personal webpage][calvellido].

Basically DPMbox aims to create a friendly web interface for Disk Pool Manager, the most widely adopted storage management system in the [WLCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid)][wlcg] infrastructure. To read a more detailed explanation about what type of development DPMbox is, you can check the [About]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) page. The development will be based strongly on JavaScript, using some well known libraries such as jQuery or jQuery UI.

This project is my final Bachelor Thesis and is currently participating in the [Concurso Universitario de Software Libre 2014/2015][cusl]. 

Here's hoping you all find the information in this blog useful, cheers! =)
